As a Frontend Developer at YSR Project, I have actively contributed to diverse modules, commencing with PreAuth and subsequently engaging in the development of the Employment Form and Job Application Portal. This experience has been invaluable, providing me with continuous learning opportunities within a collaborative team environment. The support and collaboration I receive from my team greatly contribute to my professional growth.
